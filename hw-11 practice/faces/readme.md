["Faces" Sketch](https://jolenetiffanyg.github.io/course-work/hw-10/faces/)

### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  I again really enjoyed doing this project.  I used the book a TON this week, and also watched a lot of Schiffman's tutorials.  He is excellent.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-10** Assignment

- I copied the entire folder `hw-5` to use the "face" from that sketch and then commented out or deleted most of it in order to replace with new content
- I opened the copy of `sketch.js` in **Atom** and:
  - created a canvas using `createCanvas()`
  - specified the background using the `background()` function
  - did my array at the top
  - declared a `draw()` function
  - used the `background` function again *after* the `draw` function so that when my image moved around it didn't cover the page in a trail
  - tried out different variables and played with new techniques from the lesson and **p5** website
  - tried some variations of commands I learned on the **p5** reference pages and used last week
  - commented each line as I went using `//` so I could more easily orient myself when I wanted to go back and make changes
  - left spaces between each section
  - defined two different new functions with two images and placed them roughly perpendicular to one another diagonally
  - used my array to create a sentence when the mouse is clicked
  - placed a limit so that the array would go back to element zero as soon as it passed the fifth element
  - kept the `index.html` open in my browser so I could refresh the page after each change to see how it looked
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-10/faces` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Wrote my `hw-10` **readme**
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submitted links to Moodle homework submission forum

### Problems and Issues

I actually didn't have too many problems this week.  I had a really difficult time at first understanding what an array was, but after watching Schiffman's video it became clear.  I also had a hard time conceptualizing how to make my own function, for some reason the lesson material's approach just wasn't clicking this week.  But as soon as I turned to the p5 book and opened to the chapter on defining functions it was all super simple.  Thanks so much for making us buy that particular book, it's indispensible.

### To Discuss further

I can't think of any other uses for arrays other than the specific ones that were presented in the lesson material, website, and book. They all seemed to use the same examples.  I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to use arrays, but maybe I lack the imagination to come up with some new ones.  I'm going to keep thinking about it and hopefully once the material from the last couple of weeks has had time to germinate I'll be able to have a broader understanding of potential applications for arrays.

### Helping Classmates

People seemed to have less trouble this week, maybe because we had a little time to catch up.  I've been reading on the forums but the few issues posted seemed to be either flukes I couldn't see any mistake in, or things that were easily solved.  I think this was the first project where I didn't have to ask anyone for help with anything though, so at least that's a step in the right direction!
