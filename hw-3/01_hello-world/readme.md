["Hello World!" Sketch]()

### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  I didn't have a very strong grip on  what went on the *last* homework cycle,  even after successfully completing the assignment. So I had to begin by reading back through the materials provided for week two so that I felt I had the introductory information at least somewhat established before trying to add more.  I also began reading the **p5.js** book I got in the mail, and did some independent research so that I now have a basic understanding of what the **p5** library actually is with relation to **javascript** and web browsers.  I then finally began reading through the course information provided for week 3 and took notes, then followed the assignment instruction steps.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-3** Assignment

- Firstly, I organized my directories in the following format; `course-work/hw-3/01_hello-world`
- I made sure my **p5.js** file was unzipped and in the correct place within the `01_hello-world` subdirectory of `hw-3`
- I opened the empty `sketch.js` in **Atom** and:
  - created a canvas using `createCanvas()`
  - specified the background using the `background()` function
  - made sure to comment each line using `//`
- Declared a `draw()` function
- Used the `text()` function to print **Hello World!**
- Opened `sketch.js` in browser to check that it looked right
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and changed the GitHub Pages Source Settings to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-3` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Used classmate connections and **Issues Forum** to resolve problems with the `index.html` step
- Wrote my **readme** in the empty-project file
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submit link to Moodle

### Problems and Issues
I first was completely stumped just trying to see my directory path and files within **GitHub Desktop** and on **GitHub**. Everything looked fine on Atom.  After posting on the **Issues Forum** and getting a lot of guidance from a wonderful classmate, it turned out that there was an excess of `git.` files clogging up the works.  I assume these were there because when I originally was trying to download **p5.js** I was under the impression that it was a program I was supposed to run, rather than a library I needed for language reference.  So I kept downloading it over and over again thinking it wasn't working properly.  After getting rid of those I was able to proceed.  I then had a ton of confusion with the **index.html** file and understanding how to get it to show up in my link.  I gained a somewhat better understanding of the issue by rereading the lesson and links provided, and I did some googling but I'm still having trouble understanding the language used by the people who are asking and responding to troubleshooting questions on most forums.  Fortunately we have our class forum and some extremely helpful classmates, without whom I would not be able to keep up in this class.

### To Discuss further
I'm still pretty lost as far as framing my little bits of understanding, but I *do* know more than I did last week, and can do a lot more than I could before we started.  I'm working on trying to be patient as far as understanding this process as a whole is concerned, so for now I just need to do more independent reading and focus on the specifics and learn the commands.  I'm hoping the general scope becomes gradually clearer as we progress.

### Helping Classmates

  I still feel like I'm scraping the very bottom of the food chain in this class.  I checked out other people's projects and based on the **readme** files, it sounds like this week was a breeze for some of the other students.  Given, at this point there are still many who have not submitted their assignments so it shouldn't be a huge shock that those who have submitted their finished repositories a bit earlier would be the ones who already know what they are doing.  I am keeping an eye on the **Issues Forum** so that if anyone comes across anything similar to the things I've had to work through, I can tell them how I fixed the problem.  I've also been trying to look closely at exact directory names and links when people provide screenshots in the **Issues Forum**, given the obscene amount of time I spent troubleshooting on the last assignment after capitalizing a letter that shouldn't have been.
