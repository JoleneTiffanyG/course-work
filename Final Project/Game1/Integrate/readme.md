["Interaction" Sketch](https://jolenetiffanyg.github.io/course-work/hw-12/interaction/)

### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  Read through class materials and book material, watched a long string of Schiffman videos (thank g'd for that man!) and did a lot of practicing with different approaches.  It turned out to be most helpful starting out to do sketches similarly modeled after example sketches on the p5 website and course material, and then alter things I wasn't certain about, until I gleaned a better understanding of how each part of the code worked.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-12** Assignment

-this week I actually checked the Issues Forum *before* I was in a frustrated panic, and there werent' many people participating yet but I tried to offer what little advice I could to the several who had already started working and were running into issues.
- declared setup function
- created the canvas
- tried to use object oriented programming to create the sketch I had in mind
- couldn't quite get any results like what I had in mind
- started with my OOP project from last week, with the idea to duplicate it from the opposite direction and have the objects interact
- ran into some difficulties with this and moved on to a new approach
- used the bouncing ball project format from a few weeks ago and defined a "sphere" class with the iterations in an array
-tried to have something else happen when the spheres froze up against each other but couldn't quite understand how to affect that part
-tried adding in another object to be controlled by mouse movement that would interact with the bouncers, but it kept breaking the code
-decided I like the sketch just fine the way it is and imagination is for people who understand coding on a deeper level
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-12/interaction` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Wrote my `hw-12` **readme**
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submitted links to Moodle homework submission forum

### Problems and Issues

I think I have a more solid grip on Object Oriented Programming than I did last week.  I still don't have most of these functions or methods of organization committed to memory at all though, and it reeeeaally slows everything down and makes things much more confusing than they might otherwise be. Maybe I'll try making flashcards or something akin to that.

### To Discuss further

I've looked ahead to check out what the final project is going to entail, and I'm not sure what level of complexity is required or how specific the parameters are.. But even if it was going to be super simple, I'm really nervous about submitting a project proposal and then following it to the letter.  I have yet to complete a sketch that looks even Remotely like what I set out to do, so trying to follow my own directions is a huge leap from where I am right now.  I understand that having an end result that looks like what you had imagined is integral to this process, to say the least.  But I'm not there yet and I'm not sure how to make that huge stretch in just two weeks time.

### Helping Classmates

I actually did more than beg for assistance this week.  I've been participating a fair amount, but it's mostly having superior students help troubleshoot, or trying to organize a study group.  I haven't had much to offer in the way of help.  I'm pretty sure I'm never going to be an expert troubleshooter, but I did at least respond to those who were asking for help at the time of writing this. Hopefully at least some of it was actually helpful.
