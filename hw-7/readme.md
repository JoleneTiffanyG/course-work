### Description of What the Original Code is Doing


    if (ball.x >= width || ball.x <= 0) {

This line is a conditional statement using variables.  It means that if the x axis position of the ball becomes equal to or greater than the width of the canvas, then the x axis value of the ball then becomes less than the width of the canvas.  Meaning when the ball hits the edge, it must go back.  It is constrained.



    ball.delta_x = -1 * ball.delta_x;

How can you make the ball change direction?

## How I Altered the Sketch

The first thing I did was to change the background to a deep green and then to change the ball color to a random color generator resetting every frame.  It made the overall image much more interesting as the velocity of the ball changed.  I also changed the size of the ball just for my own personal preference.  Once the image looked the way I liked, I started looking into changing the direction of the ball's movement.
