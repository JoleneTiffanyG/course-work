- failed
- tried reading the p5 book for another perspective
- failed
- watched all of the Schiffman videos that were even slightly relevant
- failed
- read through every tiny inch of code for any errors.  code still broken.
- opened up a brand new folder and completely redid the project, just in case I was unable to see the error I was making
- failed

- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-11/orbs` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`

### Problems and Issues

This whole week is a giant problem.  I thought I got the concept but I just CANNOT make it work.

### To Discuss further

I need to discuss everything apparently.

### Helping Classmates

Not even close.  I'm not sure if other people are getting it or not, the only other projects I'm able to view seem to be code copied and pasted from either the book or p5 site, with just a few alterations.
