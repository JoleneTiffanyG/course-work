### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  I watched three of Daniel Schiffman's Youtube tutorials about six times apiece.  I read through the lesson material and used provided examples from there and from the p5.js website.  I altered the example material and tried out different loops.  I spent several hours troubleshooting because of a missing curly bracket.  Then opened this sketch and wrote a very simple sketch of ellipses that filled the screen but left some canvas visible behind, and a large centered ellipse that changed size with the x position of the mouse.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-8** Assignment
 -Review lesson material
 -watch Schiffman tutorials
 -reviewed loops in the p5 book
 -reviewed loops on the p5 website
 -copied and altered practice loops
 -wrote my own loop
 -nested an additional loop within that loop
 -wrote a map function
 -finished my readme.
-pushed to Github
-uploaded live link and repo to Moodle
-read issues forum

### Problems and Issues

I spend an obscene amount of time frustrated on this project.  I guess I got a little cocky and forgot about the simple mistakes since it was an easy week.  So whicle I feel faaairly confident about using loops and nested loops, I ended up spending several hours thinking I could not possibly do this project, all because I forgot I needed a third curly bracket at the end of everything.

### To Discuss further

I really appreciate you giving us a little time to catch up.  This is all a little overwhelming at times and having a free(ish) week to spend time with our textbooks and the tutorials available is exceedingly helpful.  Not to mention well-timed.


### Helping Classmates

Not yet.  Keeping an eye on the issues forum for all those who pushed the sketch to the last second tonight.  Hoping after using this week to catch up a little bit I can be of some sort of assistance to someone someday.
