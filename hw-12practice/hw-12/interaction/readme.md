["Orbs" Sketch](https://jolenetiffanyg.github.io/course-work/hw-11/orbs/)

### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  I read through the class materials about eighty times and pulled out a lot of my hair.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-11** Assignment

- declared setup function
- created the canvas
- tried to use object oriented programming to create the sketch I had in mind
- failed
- tried googling for a different perspective
- failed
- tried reading the p5 book for another perspective
- failed
- watched all of the Schiffman videos that were even slightly relevant
- failed
- read through every tiny inch of code for any errors.  code still broken.
- opened up a brand new folder and Completely redid the project (four times), just in case I was unable to see the error I was making
- failed
- got some advice on the GitHub Issues forum but was still unable to troubleshoot what was happening
- after hours of trying suddenly it worked and I couldn't figure out where the problem had been
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-11/orbs` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Wrote my `hw-11` **readme**
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submitted links to Moodle homework submission forum

### Problems and Issues

I'm still pretty confused by the application of this concept.  I still don't know what all mistakes I was making.  I just kept getting a black canvas, so the code wasn't toootally broken.  I found most of the mistakes but in the end I ended up needing help to get the last bit to work and when it finally worked I didn't know which of the things I had just done were responsible for making it work.

### To Discuss further

I'm going to have to spend a lot more time practicing this before I'm ready to take this any further with next week's project.

### Helping Classmates

Definitely not able to help anyone.  But I am SO appreciative to those who already understand coding and are taking the time to help the rest of us on the Issues Forum.  Stellar humans.
