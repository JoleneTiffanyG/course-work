### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  I again really enjoyed doing this project.  Using the reference pages available on the **p5.js** website has made a huge difference in this class.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-4** Assignment

- I copied the entire folder `hw-4` and then renamed everything and replaced the contents
- I opened the copy of `sketch.js` in **Atom** and:
  - created a canvas using `createCanvas()`
  - specified the background using the `background()` function
  - emptied the content still in the sketch from copying the `hw-4` folder, but kept a small section and changed the colors and animated it
  - declared a `draw()` function
  - used the `background` function again *after* the `draw` function so that when my image moved around it didn't cover the page in a trail
  - tried out different variables and played with new techniques from the lesson and **p5** website
  - tried some variations of commands I learned on the **p5** reference pages and used last week
  - commented each line as I went using `//` so I could more easily orient myself when I wanted to go back and make changes
  - left spaces between each section this time (thanks for the heads up on that, so much cleaner and easier)
  - kept the `index.html` open in my browser so I could refresh the page after each change to see how it looked
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-5/mover` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Wrote my `hw-5` **readme**
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submitted links to Moodle homework submission forum

### Problems and Issues

  I didn't have any issues this week, other than when I tried out things that were still beyond my scope.  I did a lot more googling this time when I wanted to try something specific, and it was really helpful.

### To Discuss further

The coolest part of my image (personal preference) was actually something I didn't intend when I wrote that part of the sketch.  Playing around with opacity in rgba notation was fun and made things look significantly different than they would have otherwise.  I definitely am going to spend more time changing details like that in order to get a bit closer to feeling like this is actually an art form.

### Helping Classmates

I still haven't gotten ahead of anyone else yet it seems like.  I'm still watching the forums and keeping an eye on how people resolve their issues, but there hasn't been any overlap with issues I've been dealing with and I haven't seen anything incorrect in anyone's screenshots that I could see a mistake might stem from.  I'm trying.
