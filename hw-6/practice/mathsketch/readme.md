### Work I Did This Homework Cycle
  Once again I spent a ton of time looking at and testing out the examples on the **p5.js** website.  I also used the book and tried some examples provided there.  After reading through the lesson pages for this week I had to try everything out and spend time changing each little piece of a given piece of code to try and understand how it affected the appearance or speed of the image.

### Steps Taken to Complete **hw-4** Assignment

- I copied the entire folder `hw-5` and then renamed everything and replaced the contents
- I opened the copy of `sketch.js` in **Atom** and:
- defined variables at the very top to keep everything globally accessible
  - created a canvas using `createCanvas()`
  - specified the background using the `background()` function
  - declared a `draw()` function
  - tried out different variables and played with new techniques from the lesson and **p5** website
  - tried some new variations of commands I got from the relevant sections of the book
  - kept the `index.html` open in my browser so I could refresh the page after each change to see how it looked
-Watched Schiffman's Youtube tutorials multiple times trying to troubleshoot issues I was having with examples from the lesson, book, and p5 website
-Ended up drawing something entirely different from what I had in mind, went back and changed relevant variables and placement so that it could work (at least somewhat) as a cohesive sketch
- Commented out some code that is not working but I would like to continue troubleshooting
- Committed changes to the repository and pushed to **GitHub**
- Navigated to my `120-work` repository on **GitHub** and made sure GitHub Pages Source Settings were set to **master branch** to go live
- Added directory `/hw-6/mathsketch` to the end of the url to navigate to my `index.html`
- Wrote my `hw-6` **readme**
- Committed and pushed changes to repository
- Submitted links to Moodle homework submission forum

### Problems and Issues

  I had a lot of trouble with about 80% of the functions presented this week.  I feel like I understand much of it just fine in theory, but in application it either looked entirely different from what I expected as I altered different variables, or it simply resulted in a silent break.  I still have extremely simple practice sketches open that I simply cannot figure out what it wrong with the code.  For the project I simply went a different direction when I hit dead ends, but I still need to resolve the issues with the parts of the sketch I abandoned.  This was a tough week.

### To Discuss further

If I had to choose something specific that I'd like to understand right now, it's how variables work in rgba notation.  I have spent hours trying to make a variable stand in for numeric color value, to no avail.  All troubleshooting and comparison to other code points to me having done it correctly, but I can't get it to work and it's extremely frustrating.

### Helping Classmates

I definitely did not help anyone this week.  The things that I did understand well from this week I still don't understand well when it comes to application, and my grip on what I think I know is tenuous at best, if I'm being generous.  I couldn't even get help with my own issues on the forum.  I'm not sure if that's because everyone else is struggling just as much, or it was so easy for everyone else that there was no need to engage concerning issues.
